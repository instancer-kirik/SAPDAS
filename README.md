# SAPDASS
Sketchfab Auto PreferredFormat Downloader and Attribution Saver Script
to use, get a script runner extension. I use Violentmonkey.

this is listed on Greasy Fork at 

https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/501729-sketchfab-auto-preferredformat-downloader-and-attribution-saver-script
but otherwise, you can copy and paste the contents of SAPDASS.js into a new script in your script runner, and save it, then you can expedite downloading free models and saving attributions




I was making an assetpack for my nephews, and it was too much work; so I made this to help.

I support myself how I can, but I need to get $200 by the end of the month or my servers shut down. Now that isn't a lot of money, but I make a lot of free code. Help support me :D

you can probably change the order of preffered formats if you want fbx or something at

const preferredFormats = ['.blend', '.usdz', '.gltf', '.glb', '.obj', 'fbx'];

Haven't tried it on anything that uses other than these options
